			<p align="left" style="font-family: arial">Hello! My name is Ahmed Nuur and I'm a sophomore student at the University of Windsor. I'm in the degree of Computer Science and I love it so far! I'm going to tell you how exactly I got so interested in the field of Computer Science. It all started when I was in grade 7 just surfing through YouTube. I then happened to come across a video from Mark Zuckerberg and him saying that everyone should learn how to code. I was intrigued because I didn't know what coding was and apparently that is what he used to make the cool social media website of Facebook!</p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<p align="center" style="font-family: arial">There were a lot of coding geniuses in that video as well such as Bill Gates who created Microsoft and Jack Dorsey who created Twitter. After watching the video to it's entirety I then promptly signed up for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>. At this time, I didn't know what coding was exactly, all I knew was that it was a tool that you could create cool things with. I had no idea which language to start learning so I randomly chose javascript! It was strange at first but as I progressed I started liking the flow of it. </p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<p align ="right" style="font-family: arial">This inspired me to take a computer science class in high school. I took this course in grade 11 when I switched schools as my other school did not provide a course similar. The language I learned in grade 11 was Python! Python is one of my favourite languages because of my teacher first and foremost. He really understood where I needed improving and how much practice I needed on certain areas of knowledge. I liked it so much that I ended up wanting to base my entire career around it! I can say that I do not regret my decision of going into computer science and I hope to achieve amazing things in this amazing field!</p>
